- Refactor your code (MoviesMenuAPI) to Implement dependency Injection for DB context and services
	- call the context within the movie service, not directly from controller
		- this way cleaner arch, controller relies on movie service (business logic layer), movie service relies on DbContext (data access layer)
			- then our controller becomes what we call a thin controller, all it does is that it serves as an entry point for API calls (only)
- Learn MVC.
- make a page that returns a list of all movies.
- use layouts and partial views.
