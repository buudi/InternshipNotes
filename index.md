This is my digital notebook where it contains the notes I took at my time in [Bitlab Digital](https://www.thebitlab.co/) as a Backend Developer Intern.

I had my first Meeting on the first day of work with my Tech Lead, [Ariffudin Ahmad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arifuddin-ahmad-416280101/?originalSubdomain=my) who is the Solution Architect in Bitlab, where I was briefed about the bootcamp to learn C#, Dotnet and Umbraco CMS, and had my first crash course on C#.

The Bootcamp contained several exercises, for each exercise my tech lead would give me a crash course and some resources for self learning and then I would have to finish the exercise and showcase it in the review before the deadline.

I started with learning the basics of C# and making simple console applications. C# is syntactically similar to Java which I was a little familiar with from my university studies, so learning the basics of C# was a breeze.

For [[Exercise 1]], I had to make a C# Console App called "Movies Menu" where I would implement CRUD operations on a local memory `List<T>` structure.

In [[Exercise 2]], I had to use the code from the first exercise, and use a database to store and retrieve the movies data instead of a local memory structure, I used ADO.NET to write raw SQL queries, I had to ensure parametrization and organize my code in a proper n-layered architecture. Writing ADO.NET is very painful, I felt like my brain was actually frying, I hope I never have to use it again.

In Exercise 3, I learnt to use an ORM called Entity Framework Core (EF Core) for communicating with the database, which uses the C# LINQ to make queries, I am a huge fan of LINQ, and using it in EF Core instead of ADO.NET is much much much nicer and easier.

Exercise 4 : Translate the app from exercise 3 into a controller based web API

exercise 5 : Learnt ASP.NET MVC Core, implemented layouts, and partial views similar to React components.
